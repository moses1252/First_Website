            Since I live outside of school I like doing things other than homework. I Like to play Video games when I get the chance too. I own
            a Play Station 4, so that is the consol I Use. I Also love the game of basketball. I watch the game and if I feel up to it I vist 
            the court when I want. The most important thing I always make time for is family. Family is such an important factor in my life.
