                As a Computer Science major I have had a dynamac set of experiences of which I
                learned from. Each one of those experiences I took something thing from each and 
                everyone of them. This has allowed me me to expaned my horizon in terms of what I 
                capable of.

                    I have mantained a G.P.A  of 3.0 for the past two years, and as a result I have made the deans list.
                </li>
                <li>
                    During the duration of the past two years I have leared Python, MySQL, NoSQL, MongoDB, extensively deep 
                    knowledge for java. On the side I have learned the basics of html, front end and back end, and css. I 
                    also have worked with wordpress for a short period of a time, so I have work with web design in a variety 
                    of ways.

                <li>
                    I have attened a Hackathon, which I believe allowed me to expreience so much within a short span. I believe
                    this tested my leadership skills, collaboration skills, and the most important learning to quickly have a solution
                    for any problem that arose.

                    During the summer of 2018 I used PyCharm IDE to program a game using python. At this time I was working a job, so I learned to 
                    manage my work time from my programming time. I see this as an accomplishment because I spent hours into this 
                    project, and this made my passion for programming was more apparant to me. The game was a galaga type game, so there
                    was many actions in which I had to incorperate into this project.

            <h1>My Plans</h1>
            <p> 
                I have had a plan since I have graduated high school. I always set high expectations for myself because what I have planned
                for myself requires dedicaion and maximum effort. I want to expose myself to different enviroments and work because I want to
                find out what I am good at. I want to do this before i graduate, so when I am done with school I know exacly what my strong
                suit is. Not only do I want to find what I'm good at, but I want to become better and expertize in what I plan to do.
